            <div class="bio mt-3">Born July '67 in Milwaukee WI. I have lived in many places including Minneapolis MN, Houston TX, Bloomfield Hills MI, Ft Lauderdale FL, London England where I went to a boarding school named TASIS with a bunch of celebrities kids including Ringo Starrs daughter, Tallahassee FL (Graduated Lincoln High School '85) US Navy Stationed in Jacksonville FL (85-90). Education included TCC and Florida Atlantic University. I was a morning show Disc Jockey here in Tallahassee at KIX 99.9 I went by Allan Chase the Mental Case! No Judgment please! I even did some Stand Up in South Florida before finally moving back and settling in here in Tallahassee. Two things kept bringing me back; the Florida State Seminoles and Iconic Barnaby's. Although I have now discovered another gem. Brickyard Pizzaria! I've had just about every sales jobs available for the next 20 years including Real Estate, Auto, Financial, Advertising and the Mortgage & Credit Industry. I never felt truly content until getting into the Personal Shopping Biz. I now get to use all of the skills I've picked up throughout the years and get to bring my personality along with it!</div>

                <p>Born and raised in a small town in North Florida, I later moved to Orlando, FL for college and after graduating college I set out to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but I knew eventually I wanted to be part of a business that really sought to create an amazing reputation, value to its customers, and outstanding customer service. </p>
                <p>I saw all these companies that just seemed to not really care about their customers and I wanted to create a brand that really focused on helping people and bringing back amazing customer service and connection to people.</p>
                <p>I became the local store marketer at Texas Roadhouse and eventually got my real estate license. I loved Real Estate and still practice it on the side but I wanted to branch out into something that was more steady. I met Jay and he had a grocery shopping business and I was very interested in how he began the business and I fell in love with the idea of helping him grow it into something even bigger.  My mind exploded with ideas and I knew this is where all my past training in marketing, customer service, and real estate had enabled me to be an asset to Shopping Tally. I look forward to serving and building relationships with this beautiful community.</p>
